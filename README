	Twitter feeds
	  options:
	      - count:    Specifies the number of Tweets to try and retrieve. 
	                  Must be less than or equal to 200. The value you pass 
	                  as count is a maximum number of Tweets to return. 
	                  The actual number of Tweets you receive maybe less than 
	                  count due to the removal of content from suspended or 
	                  deleted users.

	                  If the limit of Tweets has occured since the since_id, 
	                  the since_id will be forced to the oldest ID available.
